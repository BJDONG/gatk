/**
 * Left-aligns indels from a variants file.
 *
 * <p>
 * LeftAlignVariants is a tool that takes a VCF file and left-aligns the indels inside it.  The same indel can often be
 * placed at multiple positions and still represent the same haplotype.  While the standard convention with VCF is to
 * place an indel at the left-most position this doesn't always happen, so this tool can be used to left-align them.
 * Note that this tool cannot handle anything other than bi-allelic, simple indels.  Complex events are written out unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>Input</h2>
 * <p>
 * A variant set to left-align.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Output</h2>
 * <p>
 * A left-aligned VCF.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <pre>
 * java -Xmx2g -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \
 *   -R ref.fasta \
 *   -T LeftAlignVariants \
 *   --variant input.vcf \
 *   -o output.vcf
