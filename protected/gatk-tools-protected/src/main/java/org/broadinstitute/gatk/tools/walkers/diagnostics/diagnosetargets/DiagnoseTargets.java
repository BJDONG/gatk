/**
 * Analyzes coverage distribution and validates read mates for a given interval and sample.
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Used to diagnose regions with bad coverage, mapping, or read mating. Analyzes each sample independently in addition
 * to interval wide analysis.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A reference file</li>
 * <li>one or more input BAMs</li>
 * <li>One or more intervals</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>
 * A modified VCF detailing each interval by sample and information for each interval according to the thresholds used.
 * Interval information includes GC Content, average interval depth, callable status among others.
 *
 * If you use the --missing option, you can get as a second output a intervals file with the loci that have missing data.
 * This file can then be used as input to QualifyMissingIntervals for full qualification and interpretation of why
 * the data is missing.
