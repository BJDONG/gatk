/**
 * Calculates genotype posterior likelihoods given panel data
 *
 * <p>
 * Given a VCF with genotype likelihoods from the HaplotypeCaller, UnifiedGenotyper, or another source which provides
 * -unbiased- GLs, calculate the posterior genotype state and likelihood given allele frequency information from
 * both the samples themselves and input VCFs describing allele frequencies in related populations.
 *
 * VCFs to use for informing the genotype likelihoods (e.g. a population-specific VCF from 1000 genomes) should have
 * at least one of:
 * - AC field and AN field
 * - MLEAC field and AN field
 * - genotypes
 *
 * The AF field will not be used in this calculation as it does not provide a way to estimate the confidence interval
 * or uncertainty around the allele frequency, while AN provides this necessary information. This uncertainty is
 * modeled by a Dirichlet distribution: that is, the frequency is known up to a Dirichlet distribution with
 * parameters AC1+q,AC2+q,...,(AN-AC1-AC2-...)+q, where "q" is the global frequency prior (typically q << 1). The
 * genotype priors applied then follow a Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution, where 2 alleles per sample are drawn
 * independently. This assumption of independent draws is the assumption Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Thus, HWE is
 * imposed on the likelihoods as a result of CalculateGenotypePosteriors.
 *
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 * <p>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>A VCF with genotype likelihoods, and optionally genotypes, AC/AN fields, or MLEAC/AN fields</li>
 *         <li>(Optional) A PED pedigree file containing the description of the individuals relationships.</li>
 *     </ul>
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A collection of VCFs to use for informing allele frequency priors. Each VCF must have one of
 * - AC field and AN field
 * - MLEAC field and AN field
 * - genotypes
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>
 * A new VCF with:
 *  1) Genotype posteriors added to the genotype fields ("PP")
 *  2) Genotypes and GQ assigned according to these posteriors
 *  3) Per-site genotype priors added to the INFO field ("PG")
 *  4) (Optional) Per-site, per-trio transmission probabilities given as Phred-scaled probability of all genotypes in the trio being correct, added to the genotype fields ("TP")
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Notes</h3>
 * <p>
 * Currently, priors will only be applied for SNP sites in the input callset (and only those that have a SNP at the
 * matching site in the priors VCF unless the --calculateMissingPriors flag is used).
 * If the site is not called in the priors, flat priors will be applied. Flat priors are also applied for any non-SNP
 * sites in the input callset.
 * </p>
