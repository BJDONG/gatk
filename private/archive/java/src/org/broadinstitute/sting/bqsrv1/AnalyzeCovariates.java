/**
 * Call R scripts to plot residual error versus the various covariates.
 *
 * <p>
 * After counting covariates in either the initial BAM File or again in the recalibrated BAM File, an analysis tool is available which
 * reads the .csv file and outputs several PDF (and .dat) files for each read group in the given BAM. These PDF files graphically
 * show the various metrics and characteristics of the reported quality scores (often in relation to the empirical qualities).
 * In order to show that any biases in the reported quality scores have been generally fixed through recalibration one should run
 * CountCovariates again on a bam file produced by TableRecalibration. In this way users can compare the analysis plots generated
 * by pre-recalibration and post-recalibration .csv files. Our usual chain of commands that we use to generate plots of residual
 * error is: CountCovariates, TableRecalibrate, samtools index on the recalibrated bam file, CountCovariates again on the recalibrated
 * bam file, and then AnalyzeCovariates on both the before and after recal_data.csv files to see the improvement in recalibration.
 *
 * <p>
 * The color coding along with the RMSE is included in the plots to give some indication of the number of observations that went into
 * each of the quality score estimates. It is defined as follows for N, the number of observations:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>light blue means N < 1,000</li>
 * <li>cornflower blue means 1,000 <= N < 10,000</li>
 * <li>dark blue means N >= 10,000</li>
 * <li>The pink dots indicate points whose quality scores are special codes used by the aligner and which are mathematically
 * meaningless and so aren't included in any of the numerical calculations.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Rscript needs to be in your environment PATH (this is the scripting version of R, not the interactive version).
 * See <a target="r-project" href="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</a> for more info on how to download and install R.
 *
