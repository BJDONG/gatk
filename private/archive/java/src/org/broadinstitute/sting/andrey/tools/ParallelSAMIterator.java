/**
 * Iterates synchronously over two SAM files. At each iteration returs alignments with the same read name (in the order
 * the read names appear in the files). Alignment(s) from the first/second SAM file will be stored as the first/second
 * element of the pair, respectively. Multiple alignments (alternative placements) for a given read are allowed in both
 * input files. If only one of the files have alignment(s) for a given read name, the returned
 * pair will contain an empty list in the element corresponding to the other file. To enable this sort of traversal
 * synchronized by read names, the input SAM files must be sorted by read name. Constructor of this class verifies
 * that this is the case: SAM file  headers must report either 'queryname' sorting order, or no sorting order
 * (to allow the code to work with not-fully compliant 3rd party tools that do not set header flags properly; a warning
 * will be currently printed to stdout in this case); if sorting order in either of the files is set to "coordinate",
 * an exception will be thrown.
