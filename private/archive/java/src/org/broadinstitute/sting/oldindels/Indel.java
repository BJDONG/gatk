/**  This class represents an indel as an interval with respect to the <i>original</i> reference and, in addition,
 * stores the indel type ( (I)nsertion or (D)eletion ) and can return meaningful event size (see below).
 * Depending on the indel type, the positions on the reference are:
 *    <ul>
 *    <li> Deletion ( e.g. deletion of ACAC from the ref: ACGTT[ACAC]TTTAG to ACGTT[]TTTAG) - start and stop of
 *         the interval are first and last deleted bases on the original reference (those in square brackets in the
 *         first sequence in the example)
 *    <li> Insertion ( e.g. insertion of GTGT into the ref: ACGTT{}TTTAG to ACGTT{GTGT}TTTAG) - start is the first
 *         position on the original reference <i>after</i> the insertion site (after the '}'), and stop is the last
 *         position <i>before</i> the insertion site (prior to '{').
 *    </ul>
 *
 * Given these definitions, the length of the interval, as returned by getLength() has the meaning of the length of
 * the event (affected bases) on the original reference: number of deleted bases for deletion and zero for insertion.
 * The length of the indel itself is returned by getIndelLength(), which is equal to getLength() for deletions and to
 * the actual number of inserted bases for insertions (while length on the reference, as returned by getLength() is zero).
 *
 * The overlaps are also meaningful with the above definitions: if an alignment to (or, in general, an interval on)
 * the original reference ends prior to <code>start</code>, or starts after <code>stop</code>, it does not overlap
 * with the indel event (neither spans over deleted region or contains any of the inserted bases).
 *
