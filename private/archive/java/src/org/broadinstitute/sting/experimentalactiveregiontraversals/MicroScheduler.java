 * General base class for all scheduling algorithms

 *
 * Creates N TraversalEngines for each data thread for the MicroScheduler.  This is necessary
 * because in the HMS case you have multiple threads executing a traversal engine independently, and
 * these engines may need to create separate resources for efficiency or implementation reasons.  For example,
 * the nanoScheduler creates threads to implement the traversal, and this creation is instance specific.
 * So each HMS thread needs to have it's own distinct copy of the traversal engine if it wants to have
 * N data threads x M nano threads => N * M threads total.  These are borrowed from this microscheduler
 * and returned when done.  Also allows us to tracks all created traversal engines so this microscheduler
 * can properly shut them all down when the scheduling is done.
