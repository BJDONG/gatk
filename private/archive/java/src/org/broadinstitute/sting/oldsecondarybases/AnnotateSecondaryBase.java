/**
 * AnnotateSecondaryBase computes the second best base for every base in an Illumina lane.
 * First, a statistical model is fit to a subset of the raw Illumina intensities (i.e. those
 * generated by Illumina's "Firecrest" package).  Then, every read's set of raw intensities
 * is evaluated against this model to determine the base probability distribution of a given
 * base observation.
 *
 * Approximately 95% of the time, this method and Illumina's basecalling package, "Bustard",
 * agree on the identity of the best base.  In these cases, we simply annotate our estimate
 * of the second-best base.  In cases where this method and Bustard disagree, we annotate
 * the secondary base as this method's primary base.
