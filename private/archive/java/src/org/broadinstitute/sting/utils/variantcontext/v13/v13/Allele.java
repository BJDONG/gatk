/**
 * Immutable representation of an allele
 *
 * Types of alleles:
 *
 * Ref: a t C g a // C is the reference base
 *
 *    : a t G g a // C base is a G in some individuals
 *
 *    : a t - g a // C base is deleted w.r.t. the reference
 *
 *    : a t CAg a // A base is inserted w.r.t. the reference sequence
 *
 * In these cases, where are the alleles?
 *
 * SNP polymorphism of C/G  -> { C , G } -> C is the reference allele
 * 1 base deletion of C     -> { C , - } -> C is the reference allele
 * 1 base insertion of A    -> { - ; A } -> Null is the reference allele
 *
 * Suppose I see a the following in the population:
 *
 * Ref: a t C g a // C is the reference base
 *    : a t G g a // C base is a G in some individuals
 *    : a t - g a // C base is deleted w.r.t. the reference
 *
 * How do I represent this?  There are three segregating alleles:
 *
 *  { C , G , - }
 *
 * Now suppose I have this more complex example:
 *
 * Ref: a t C g a // C is the reference base
 *    : a t - g a
 *    : a t - - a
 *    : a t CAg a
 *
 * There are actually four segregating alleles:
 *
 *   { C g , - g, - -, and CAg } over bases 2-4
 *
 * However, the molecular equivalence explicitly listed above is usually discarded, so the actual
 * segregating alleles are:
 *
 *   { C g, g, -, C a g }
 *
 * Critically, it should be possible to apply an allele to a reference sequence to create the
 * correct haplotype sequence:
 *
 * Allele + reference => haplotype
 *
 * For convenience, we are going to create Alleles where the GenomeLoc of the allele is stored outside of the
 * Allele object itself.  So there's an idea of an A/C polymorphism independent of it's surrounding context.
 *
 * Given list of alleles it's possible to determine the "type" of the variation
 *
 *      A / C @ loc => SNP with
 *      - / A => INDEL
 *
 * If you know where allele is the reference, you can determine whether the variant is an insertion or deletion.
 *
 * Alelle also supports is concept of a NO_CALL allele.  This Allele represents a haplotype that couldn't be
 * determined. This is usually represented by a '.' allele.
 *
 * Note that Alleles store all bases as bytes, in **UPPER CASE**.  So 'atc' == 'ATC' from the perspective of an
 * Allele.
