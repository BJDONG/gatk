/**
 * This is a container that holds all data corresponding to a single join table as specified by one -J arg (ex: -J bindingName1,/path/to/file,bindingName1.columnName=bindingName2.columnName2).
 * Some terminology:
 * 'bindingName' is an arbitrary label for a given table that is specified on the command line with either the -B or -J arg.
 * In the example above, bindingName1 is the 'local' binding name because it is attached to the join table file provided with this -J arg. bindingName2 is the 'external' binding name because
 * it corresponds to some other table specified previously with another -B or -J arg.
 *
 * The JoinTable object stores a map entry for each record in the join table. The entry's key is the value of the join column in a given record (eg. bindingName1.columnName in the above example),
 * and the entry value is an ArrayList representing the entire join table record.
 * The JoinTable object also stores some other join table parameters such as the column names that were parsed out of the file header, and the bindingNames and columnNames from the -J arg.
 *
 * The join operation is performed by looking up the value of the join column in the external table (the one that this table is being joined to), and then using this value to do a lookup
 * on the map - if there's a hit, it will provide the record from the join table that is to be joined with the record in the external table.
