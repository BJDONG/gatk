  // auto generation of the cluster plots
  // spike in NA12878 to the exomes and to the lowpass, analysis of how much of her variants are being recovered compared to single sample exome or HiSeq calls
  // produce Kiran's Venn plots based on comparison between new VCF and gold standard produced VCF
