* NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and covenants made herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:
* 
* 1. DEFINITIONS
* 1.1 PROGRAM shall mean copyright in the object code and source code known as GATK3 and related documentation, if any, as they exist on the EFFECTIVE DATE and can be downloaded from http://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk on the EFFECTIVE DATE.
