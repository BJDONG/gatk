 * Genotype consistent with MongoDB
 *
 * Has a very limited subset of the functionality of a full Genotype object.
 *
 * Contains the following four fields:
 *
 * The genotype of NA12878 at this site, encoded as two ints, allele1 and allele2
 * An optional GQ value (int) and an optional DP (int) value, both of which
 * default to the value -1, meaning not present.
 *
 * Important information about the encoding:
 *
 * If allele1 and allele2 are -1, this means that the genotype is UNKNOWN (equivalent to the VCF encoding ./.)
 * If allele1 and allele2 are 0 or 1, this implies that NA12878 has a known genotype corresponding to the
 * VCF genotype encoding allele1/allele2.  So, if the site has ref/alt alleles and NA12878 is alt/alt here
 * then allele1 and allele2 should both be equal to 1.
 * If GQ == 0, then the genotype is considered discordant, but this should only be used by the consensus algorithm
