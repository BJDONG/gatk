/**
 * Standalone program to create an XML index of the GSA pipeline directory tree suitable for loading in IGV.
 *
 * Non-empty directories are added to the XML index as "Category" elements, with the exception that
 * directories in the *root* of the GSA pipeline directory tree must have five-character names starting
 * with "P" in order to be indexed.
 *
 * The following are added to the XML index as "Resource" elements:
 *
 *     -bam files for Picard projects/samples listed in tsv files found within the GSA pipeline directory tree,
 *      provided the bams and their corresponding bais actually exist within the appropriate Picard directory.
 *      The most current version of each Picard bam is always chosen. Symlinks are created to the actual Picard
 *      bam/bai files in subdirectories named BAM_LINKS_SUBDIRECTORY within the directory in which each tsv file
 *      was found.
 *
 *     -"Project" vcf files -- that is, vcf files that have a tsv file of the same name present in the same directory.
 *
 *     -Files that end with one of the RESOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
 *
 * Files/directories beginning with one of the prefixes in FILENAME_BLACKLIST are always excluded from indexing,
 * even if they fall into one of the categories above.
 *
 * All elements are sorted in the output XML file, with "Category" elements always coming before "Resource"
 * elements, and elements of the same type being sorted lexicographically by their "name" attributes.
 *
 * USAGE EXAMPLES:
 *
 * -Run with default settings:
 *
 *     java -classpath dist/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar org.broadinstitute.gatk.utils.pipeline.GSAPipelineIndexer
 *
 * This produces an index of the DEFAULT_ROOT_DIRECTORY, replacing the path to that directory with
 * DEFAULT_WEB_ROOT in all URLs generated, and writing the output to XML file DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FILE.
 *
 * -Run with custom settings:
 *
 *     java -classpath dist/GenomeAnalysisTK.jar org.broadinstitute.gatk.utils.pipeline.GSAPipelineIndexer \
 *          --rootDirectory directory_to_index \
 *          --webRoot web_alias_for_directory_to_index \
 *          --outputFile path_to/output.xml
 *
 * This produces an index of directory_to_index, replacing the path to that directory with
 * web_alias_for_directory_to_index in all URLs generated, and writing the output to XML file
 * path_to/output.xml
